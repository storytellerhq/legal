# Glossary

_Effective June 26, 2012_

Please refer to this Glossary while reviewing the [Storyteller Terms of Service][1] and these other terms and policies: the [Privacy Policy][2], the [Acceptable Use Policy][3] and the [Trademark Usage Guidelines.][4] We have our own language, but we think you will find it as intuitive as Storyteller itself.

### Company

Company means Sparkart Group, Inc., the company that provides the **Storyteller Services**. Sparkart Group, Inc. is a California corporation located at 2201 Broadway, Suite 100, Oakland, California 94612, United States.

### Storyteller Services

Storyteller Services means the services that Company makes available through this website, including this website, the Storyteller cloud computing platform for creating and presenting **Websites**, any related documentation and support services, and any other Storyteller software or services offered by Company in connection with any of those.

### Website

In Storyteller lingo, we use the term Website to refer to what the Storyteller **Customer** creates using the Storyteller Services, usually websites and web applications.

### Customer

In Storyteller lingo, anyone with a Storyteller account is a Customer. Note that not all Customers are **Website Owners**.

### Website Owner

The Website Owner is the Storyteller **Customer** who holds the primary Storyteller customer account that is associated with the corresponding Website. The Website Owner is responsible for the payment of fees incurred with respect to the corresponding Website.

### Invite

An Invite is the method by which Customers grant **Permissions** to other Customers.

### Permissions

Permissions are the varying levels of access for Customers to collaborate on Websites within the Storyteller Service. For example, one Customer may have limited access to preview an unpublished Website (or the unpublished portion, modification or revision of a published Website), while another Customer may have limited access to edit content, while another Customer may have full access to work on the design and development of the Website. The extent of the Permission is determined by the Invite.

### End User

The End User is the visitor of the published Website.

### API

API is a familiar industry term – it is an abbreviation for application programming interface. There are thousands of APIs made available by Resources that enable the use of content and data from the Resource.

### Resource

In Storyteller lingo, the Resource is the source on the Internet of an API. The Storyteller Service helps the Customer access APIs that enable the Customer to present on the Website content and data served by the Resource.

### Resource Content

The content and data on the Internet that is accessible via an API is referred to in the Storyteller Service as the Resource Content. There is an incredibly wide array of Resource Content available to Customers for presentation on their Websites. Here are a few basic examples: photos that a Customer posts to the Customer’s Facebook page; blog posts that the Customer posts to his or her blog on Wordpress; videos that the Customer posts on YouTube; Twitter streams; real time weather data from AccuWeather; etc. etc. etc. That is a very short list. There are literally thousands of examples of Resources that provide access to APIs that enable the use of Resource Content.

### API Terms and Conditions

Often times, the use of a Resource’s API is governed by terms and conditions agreed to by the party using the API.
